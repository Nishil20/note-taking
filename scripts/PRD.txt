# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. **Risk**: Rich text editor complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with a simple editor and iteratively add features. Use established libraries like TipTap or Slate.js rather than building from scratch.

2. **Risk**: Search performance with large datasets
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper MongoDB indexing from the start. Use pagination and consider caching strategies for frequent searches.

3. **Risk**: Mobile responsiveness challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Adopt a mobile-first design approach with Tailwind CSS. Test regularly on various device sizes throughout development.

## MVP Scope
1. **Risk**: Feature creep extending development time
   - **Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize features for the MVP. Use the task management system to track and contain scope.

2. **Risk**: Over-engineering initial architecture
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler implementations that can be extended later. Focus on core functionality first.

3. **Risk**: User experience complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct early usability testing with simple prototypes. Gather feedback on the core user flows before adding advanced features.

## Resource Constraints
1. **Risk**: Development time limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage shadcn/ui and Tailwind to accelerate UI development. Consider using boilerplate code for common patterns.

2. **Risk**: Testing coverage
   - **Mitigation**: Implement automated testing for critical paths early. Use Jest for unit tests and potentially Cypress for end-to-end testing.

3. **Risk**: Performance optimization
   - **Mitigation**: Establish performance budgets early. Implement monitoring to catch performance regressions.
